  <!-- Explanation: currentSate isn't subscribed to an Observable, so it won't receive live updates.
       It only updates when the parent component is recreated (e.g., via route navigation). -->

  <p>Shared State 🡪 {{ message }}</p>
  <p class="gray-text note-small">
    Note: This Shared State updates in real-time
  </p>
  <!-- Explanation: message is subscribed to a BehaviorSubject Observable, so it updates immediately when the shared state changes. -->
